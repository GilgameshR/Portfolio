							power thousands of houses, and its job is only becomming more and more
							important as our need for electricity increases. here at the museum we
							exhibit a scaled version of this very dam. best of all? its fully operational,
							learn everything there is to know about why this energy source and it's
							potential for the future!

							and people have begun questioning whether these oil rigs should be allowed
							to continue operating. Our scaled model shows you how these works, and
							our goal is to help you learn enough to form your own opinion, weighing
							both the pros and cons.
